# Sky Data ✈️

What we missed the most the years of continuous lockdowns are the trips all around the world. 
So in order to take a trip you have to organise and plan it. And there this script will be useful.
So just by following the steps shown in the <a href='https://github.com/new92/SkyData#installation-'>Installation</a> section you can have access to a variety 
of data for airports, flights, arrivals, departures etc. So with the information provided by the script you can plan your trip perfectly !

> Example: I've planned a huge trip to Europe, Asia, US etc. and booked a flight a long time ago 
(lets say 2 months ago) and I can't remember the time or/and the gate of my departure. 
So instead of searching among thousands of emails to find the specific one, I execute this script 
(which I've previously downloaded) and with just one step I have the answer plus access to a 
variety of other data which I can use them for another trip !

> Another Example: My friend from Italy is coming to the US for the first time in their life !
So I want to make a good impression once they get here. And to do that I need to track their
flight. So I search in the internet for a track-the-flight program/website but unfortunately
all are unavavailable. Therefore I use this script (which I've previously downloaded) to
get information (such as: time and date of arrival, the gate, the airport etc.) about the arrival 
of my friend's flight.
